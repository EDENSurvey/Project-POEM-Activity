# Project-POEM-Activity

This repository stores the materials for an activity that uses sonified light curves to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanetary system.
It was originally developed for [Project POEM](http://poem.coe.arizona.edu/), which aims to foster interest in STEM careers among visually impaired middle and high school students.
The activity was piloted with a group of students in June 2018 and signficantly refined in June 2019 for use with a second group.
